# MAST_DAQ
A data aquisition system for the McMaster Aerospace Team
Intended to gather altitude, accelleration, and GPS data and save it to a SD card
Uses an Arduino Uno, GT-U7 GPS Module, MPU6050 Accelerometer, and a micro SD Card adapter
Turning the system on will immediately create a new csv file on the SD card and start writing accelerometer and GPS data to it.
